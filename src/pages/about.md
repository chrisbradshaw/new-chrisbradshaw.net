### Early Days

Back in 2014, as an ambitious entrepreneur launching an ecommerce biz, I found myself staring at an intimidating web development bill. That's when I thought, "Why not give this a shot myself?" Thus began my coding journey. 🎮

My newfound interest led me to the esteemed Flatiron School in the heart of NYC. With a rigorous <7% acceptance rate, I immersed myself in their intensive bootcamp.

### SpinMedia / Group Nine Media

Upon graduating, I hit the ground running at SpinMedia Group as an AdTech Engineer. I engineered slick JavaScript ad units for major sites like [Spin](https://www.spin.com), [Vibe](https://www.vibe.com), and [Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com) , reaching over 22M unique visitors per month. 🌐

Next, I moved to Group Nine Media in Soho, where I joined the Consumer Experience team. Here, I honed my skills on all things G9: [Thrillist](https://www.thrillist.com), [POPSUGAR](https://www.popsugar.com), [The Dodo](https://www.thedodo.com), [NowThis News](https://www.nowthisnews.com), and [Seeker](https://www.seeker.com). 📚

### Warby Parker

In 2021, I joined [Warby Parker](https:/www.warbyparker.com) as a Senior Front End Engineer, where I contributed significantly to the brand's online experience. I lead projects that redesigned the checkout experience, adding Guest Checkout, building Insurance/Promo Codes functionality and streamlining PayPal integrations. 🛍️

### Spotify

Fast forward to 2022 (and beyond), and you'll find me at Spotify, jamming out on the Amplify team. As a web engineer, I'm tuning up [Ad Studio](https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/), with a key focus on amplifying new advertiser sign-ups and existing advertiser retention. 🎵
