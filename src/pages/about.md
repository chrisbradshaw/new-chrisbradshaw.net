### Bio

Hi, I'm Chris Bradshaw, a full stack web developer from NYC.

My journey to become a software engineer began when I was building an ecommerce business in 2014. I paid a lot of money for someone else to build my website, and after seeing the bill, I decided to learn how to build them myself. I started taking classes online and instantly found my passion. I applied and was accepted to the Flatiron School, a web immersive bootcamp with at that time, a <7% acceptance rate on 11 Broadway in New York City's financial district (right in front of the Charging Bull statue).

Out of Flatiron School, I was hired by SpinMedia Group as an AdTech Engineer building out Javascript advertising units on sites like [Spin](https://www.spin.com), [Vibe](https://www.vibe.com), and [Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com) reaching over 22M unique visitors per month.

After SpinMedia, I joined Group Nine Media in Soho, New York City on the Consumer Experience team working on all aspects of G9's owned and operated sites [Thrillist](https://www.thrillist.com), [POPSUGAR](https://www.popsugar.com), [The Dodo](https://www.thedodo.com), [NowThis News](https://www.nowthisnews.com), [NowThis Originals](https://www.nowthisoriginals.com) and [Seeker](https://www.seeker.com).

In February 2021, I started a new position at Warby Parker as a Senior Front End Engineer. I worked on the WWW team building out features for [warbyparker.com](https://www.warbyparker.com) including Guest Checkout, Insurance/Coupons/Promo Codes, PayPal integrations and many more.

In June of 2022, I started at Spotify working on the Amplify (advertising) team. I'm a web engineer working on [Ad Studio](https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/), with a focus on new advertiser sign ups and existing advertiser retention.
